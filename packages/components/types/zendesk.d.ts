   * If your application has a login flow, or if a user needs to access the same conversation from multiple devices,

   * For information on creating signing keys, see
   * [Authenticating end users in messaging](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411666638746).
   * For information on creating JWT tokens, see
   * [Enabling authenticated visitors for messaging with Zendesk SDKs](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/zendesk-web-widget-sdks/sdks/web/enabling_auth_visitors).
   *
   * ## Expiring JWTs
   * If you want to generate credentials that expire after a certain amount of time, using JWTs is a good way to
   * accomplish this.
   *
   * The `exp` (expiration time) property of a JWT payload is honored by the messaging Web Widget.
   * A request made with a JWT which has an `exp` that is in the past is rejected.
   *
   * Keep in mind that using JWTs with `exp` means you need to handle regeneration of JWTs in the function that you
   * provide when calling the `loginUser` API.
